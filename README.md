# Passage Master
Using Passage Master, you can memorize anything.  It's based off of the Charlotte Mason memorization/review methodology.

## About
Passage Master was developed using Ionic 2 on the front end, and Node + MongoDB (using Mongoose) on the backend.  It's deployed to heroku, and uses mLab MongoDB for database hosting.  It has a homepage (`client/index.html`) based on a TEMPLATED template.  It uses Auth0 Lock for authentication, and Google Analytics for analytics.
